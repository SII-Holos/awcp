Cancel active delegations.

## When to use

- The delegation is taking longer than expected
- You no longer need the result (e.g., found an alternative solution)
- You want to abort and try a different approach

Cancellation frees up remote executor resources promptly.

## Parameters
- **delegation_id** (optional): Specific delegation ID to cancel
- **all** (optional): Cancel all running delegations for this session

## Examples

### Cancel a specific delegation
```
delegate_cancel(delegation_id: "dlg_abc123")
```

### Cancel all running delegations
```
delegate_cancel(all: true)
```
