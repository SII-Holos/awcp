Retrieve status or results from a background delegation.

This is your primary tool for getting results after launching `delegate(background: true)`.

## When to use

- **Check progress**: See if a delegation is still running or has completed
- **Retrieve results**: Get the final output once the task is done
- **Wait for completion**: Block until the delegation finishes (use with `block: true`)

## Parameters
- **delegation_id** (required): The ID returned from `delegate(background: true)`
- **block** (optional): If true, waits for the delegation to complete before returning
- **timeout** (optional): Maximum seconds to wait when blocking (default: 60)

## Recommended usage

After launching background delegations and completing other work, use `block: true` to wait for results:

```
# Earlier: launched delegation
delegate(background: true, ...) → "dlg_abc123"

# Now: ready for the result
delegate_output(delegation_id: "dlg_abc123", block: true, timeout: 300)
```

For long-running tasks, increase the timeout accordingly.

## Examples

### Wait for result (most common)
```
delegate_output(delegation_id: "dlg_abc123", block: true, timeout: 120)
```

### Quick status check (non-blocking)
```
delegate_output(delegation_id: "dlg_abc123")
```

### Collect multiple results
```
delegate_output(delegation_id: "dlg_1", block: true)
delegate_output(delegation_id: "dlg_2", block: true)
```
